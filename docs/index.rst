Overview
--------

Jess is an algorithm for constraint-based structural template matching
proposed by Jonathan Barker & Janet Thornton. It can be used to identify
catalytic residues from a known template inside a protein structure. Jess
is an evolution of TESS, a geometric hashing algorithm developed by
Andrew Wallace *et al.*, removing some pre-computation and 
structural requirements from the original algorithm. Jess was further 
updated and maintained by `Ioannis Riziotis <https://github.com/iriziotis>`_
during his PhD in the `Thornton group <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/thornton/>`_.

PyJess is a Python module that provides bindings to Jess using
`Cython <https://cython.org/>`_:

.. grid:: 1 2 3 3
   :gutter: 1

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`battery-full` Batteries-included

      Just add ``pyjess`` as a ``pip`` or ``conda`` dependency, no need
      for the Jess binary or any external dependency.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`screwdriver-wrench` Flexible

      Load a `~pyjess.Molecule` from a :wiki:`.pdb` file or create 
      it programmatically through the :doc:`Python API <api/index>`.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`gears` Practical

      Retrieve results as they become availble as dedicated 
      `~pyjess.Hit` objects, and compute statistics on-the-fly.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`server` Parallel

      Easily run computations in parallel querying thread-safe 
      `~pyjess.Jess` with several `~pyjess.Molecule` in parallel.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`check` Consistent

      Get the same results as Jess, with some additional bug fixes for 
      edge cases of the original implementation.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`toolbox` Feature-complete

      Access all the features of the original CLI through the 
      :doc:`Python API <api/index>`, including atom coordinate 
      transformation.


Setup
-----

PyJess is available for all modern Python versions (3.7+).

Run ``pip install pyjess`` in a shell to download the latest release from PyPI,
or have a look at the :doc:`Installation page <guide/install>` to find other ways 
to install PyJess.
