## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

Jess is an algorithm for constraint-based structural template matching
proposed by Jonathan Barker *et al.*[\[1\]](#ref1). It can be used to identify
catalytic residues from a known template inside a protein structure. Jess
is an evolution of TESS, a geometric hashing algorithm developed by
Andrew Wallace *et al.*[\[2\]](#ref2), removing some pre-computation and 
structural requirements from the original algorithm. Jess was further 
updated and maintained by [Ioannis Riziotis](https://github.com/iriziotis)
during his PhD in the [Thornton group](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/thornton/).

PyJess is a Python module that provides bindings to Jess using
[Cython](https://cython.org/). It allows creating templates, querying them
with protein structures, and retrieving the hits using a Python API without
performing any external I/O.


## üîß Installing

PyJess is available for all modern Python versions (3.6+).

It can be installed directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyjess/),
which hosts some pre-built x86-64 wheels for Linux, MacOS, and Windows,
as well as the code required to compile from source with Cython:
```console
$ pip install pyjess
```

<!-- Otherwise, PyJess is also available as a [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
package:
```console
$ conda install -c bioconda pyjess
``` -->

Check the [*install* page](https://pyjess.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)
of the documentation for other ways to install PyJess on your machine.

## üí° Example

Load templates to be used as references from different template files:

```python
import glob
import pyjess

templates = []
for path in sorted(glob.iglob("vendor/jess/examples/template_*.qry")):
    templates.append(Template.load(path, id=os.path.basename(path)))
```

Create a `Jess` instance and use it to query a molecule (a PDB structure)
against the stored templates:

```python
jess = Jess(templates)
mol = Molecule("vendor/jess/examples/test_pdbs/pdb1a0p.ent")
query = jess.query(mol, rmsd_threshold=2.0, distance_cutoff=3.0, max_dynamic_distance=3.0)
```

The hits are computed iteratively, and the different output statistics are
computed on-the-fly when requested:

```python
for hit in query:
    print(hit.molecule.id, hit.template.id, hit.rmsd, hit.log_evalue)
    for atom in hit.atoms():
        print(atom.name, atom.x, atom.y, atom.z)
```


## üß∂ Thread-safety

Once a `Jess` instance has been created, the templates cannot be edited anymore,
making the `Jess.query` method re-entrant. This allows querying several
molecules against the same templates in parallel using a thread pool:

```python
molecules = []
for path in glob.glob("vendor/jess/examples/test_pdbs/*.ent"):
    molecules.append(Molecule.load(path))

with multiprocessing.ThreadPool() as pool:
    hits = pool.map(jess.query, molecules)
```

*‚ö†Ô∏è Prior to PyJess `v0.2.1`, the Jess code was running some thread-unsafe operations which have now been patched. 
If running Jess in parallel, make sure to use `v0.2.1` or later to use the code patched with re-entrant functions*.
