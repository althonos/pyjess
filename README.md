## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

Jess is an algorithm for constraint-based structural template matching
proposed by Jonathan Barker *et al.*[\[1\]](#ref1). It can be used to identify
catalytic residues from a known template inside a protein structure. Jess
is an evolution of TESS, a geometric hashing algorithm developed by
Andrew Wallace *et al.*[\[2\]](#ref2), removing some pre-computation and
structural requirements from the original algorithm. Jess was further
updated and maintained by [Ioannis Riziotis](https://github.com/iriziotis)
during his PhD in the [Thornton group](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/thornton/).

PyJess is a Python module that provides bindings to Jess using
[Cython](https://cython.org/). It allows creating templates, querying them
with protein structures, and retrieving the hits using a Python API without
performing any external I/O. It's also more than 10x faster than Jess thanks to
[algorithmic optimizations](https://pyjess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/optimizations.html)
added to improve the original Jess code while producing consistent results.


## üîß Installing

PyJess is available for all modern Python versions (3.7+).

It can be installed directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyjess/),
which hosts some pre-built x86-64 wheels for Linux, MacOS, and Windows,
as well as the code required to compile from source with Cython:
```console
$ pip install pyjess
```

Otherwise, PyJess is also available as a [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
package:
```console
$ conda install -c bioconda pyjess
```

Check the [*install* page](https://pyjess.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/install.html)
of the documentation for other ways to install PyJess on your machine.


## üîñ Citation

PyJess is scientific software, and builds on top of Jess. Please cite
Jess if you are using it in an academic work, for instance as:

> PyJess, a Python library binding to Jess (Barker *et al.*, 2003).


## üí° Example

Load [`Template`](https://pyjess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/template.html#pyjess.Template) 
objects to be used as references from different template files:

```python
import pathlib
import pyjess

templates = []
for path in sorted(pathlib.Path("vendor/jess/examples").glob("template_*.qry")):
    templates.append(pyjess.Template.load(path, id=path.stem))
```

Create a [`Jess`](https://pyjess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/jess.html#pyjess.Jess) instance and use it to query a [`Molecule`](https://pyjess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/molecule.html#pyjess.Molecule) (a PDB structure)
against the stored templates:

```python
jess = pyjess.Jess(templates)
mol = pyjess.Molecule.load("vendor/jess/examples/test_pdbs/pdb1a0p.ent")
query = jess.query(mol, rmsd_threshold=2.0, distance_cutoff=3.0, max_dynamic_distance=3.0)
```

The hits are computed iteratively, and the different output statistics are
computed on-the-fly when requested:

```python
for hit in query:
    print(hit.molecule.id, hit.template.id, hit.rmsd, hit.log_evalue)
    for atom in hit.atoms():
        print(atom.name, atom.x, atom.y, atom.z)
```


## üß∂ Thread-safety

Once a [`Jess`](https://pyjess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/jess.html#pyjess.Jess) 
instance has been created, the templates cannot be edited anymore,
making the [`Jess.query`](https://pyjess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/jess.html#pyjess.Jess.query) method re-entrant and thread-safe. This allows querying 
several molecules against the same templates in parallel using e.g a 
[`ThreadPool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool):

```python
molecules = []
for path in glob.glob("vendor/jess/examples/test_pdbs/*.ent"):
    molecules.append(Molecule.load(path))

with multiprocessing.ThreadPool() as pool:
    hits = pool.map(jess.query, molecules)
```

*‚ö†Ô∏è Prior to PyJess `v0.2.1`, the Jess code was running some thread-unsafe operations which have now been patched.
If running Jess in parallel, make sure to use `v0.2.1` or later to use the code patched with re-entrant functions*.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Benchmarks

The following table reports the runtime of PyJess to match N=132 protein 
structures to the M=7607 templates of 
[EnzyMM](https://github.com/RayHackett/enzymm), using J=12 threads to parallelize.

| Version     | Runtime (s) | Match Speed (N * M / s * J) | Speedup     |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| ``v0.4.2``  | 618.1       | 135.4                       | N/A         |
| ``v0.5.0``  | 586.3       | 142.7                       | x1.05       |
| ``v0.5.1``  | 365.6       | 228.9                       | x1.69       |
| ``v0.5.2``  | 327.2       | 255.7                       | x1.88       |
| ``v0.6.0``  | 54.5        | 1535.4                      | x11.34      |
| ``v0.7.0``  | 52.4        | 1597.5                      | **x11.80**  |

*Benchmarks were run on a quiet [i7-1255U](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/226259/intel-core-i71255u-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz/specifications.html)
